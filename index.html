And anyway, the lightning flash just about the time she was coming down the creek, but she was holding on to the drawer of a cabinet that must have been in her bedroom or something. And she must have gotten out of the house through a window or something. And the cabinet was there and she grabbed it. And so I did fish her out but she was all muddy and I suppose she was maybe about, I don't know, six or something like that. And so I tried to grab her off the balcony that we were standing on. And when she started slipping she didn't have any clothes on as I remembered. But her whole body was very slippery. So I tried to grab her and she started slipping out of my hands. But I held on to her until I got down to her feet and she was about ready to keep going past the house we were in and I grabbed her by the foot and dragged her over and she spent the rest of the time there with the three of us. And so she and I held each other really closely to keep warm because it was icy cold.”",
